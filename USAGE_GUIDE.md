# Adapting Atomic Design iOS Application

This document provides guidelines for developers who want to adapt the Atomic Design methodology and use the provided Theme module in their own projects. The focus is on how you can leverage the existing codebase to implement Atomic Design principles in your own iOS applications.

## Using the Theme Module

The `Theme` module provides a flexible way to manage themes in your application. Follow these steps to integrate it into your project:

1. Copy the `Theme` folder from this project into your own project.
2. Use the `ThemeManager` singleton to manage themes. For example:

   ```swift
   let themeManager = ThemeManager.shared
   ```

3. Access the current theme using:

   ```swift
   themeManager.currentTheme
   ```

4. Apply theme properties (e.g., colors, fonts) to your UI components. For example:

   ```swift
   Text("Hello, World!")
       .font(themeManager.currentTheme.fonts.body)
       .foregroundColor(themeManager.currentTheme.colors.text)
   ```

5. Customize the themes by modifying `ThemeManager.swift` to add your own themes.

## Developing Components

Follow the Atomic Design methodology to create reusable components:

1. **Atoms**:
   - Create small, reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, labels).
   - Use the `Theme` module to style these elements.

2. **Molecules**:
   - Combine atoms to create slightly more complex components.
   - Ensure that molecules are still reusable and follow SwiftUI best practices.

3. **Organisms**:
   - Combine molecules and atoms to create complex UI components.
   - Use `@EnvironmentObject` to access the `ThemeManager` and other shared data.

## Practicing with the Current Project

You can clone this project and use it as a sandbox to practice Atomic Design principles:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode and explore the `Components`, `Theme`, and `Views` folders.
3. Try creating new atoms, molecules, and organisms by following the existing patterns.

## Adapting the Code to Your Project

1. Copy the relevant components (e.g., `LoginButton`, `SongCell`) into your project.
2. Ensure that the `Theme` module is included and properly configured.
3. Modify the components to fit your application's requirements while maintaining the Atomic Design principles.

## Benefits of Atomic Design

- **Reusability**: Build components that can be reused across different parts of your application.
- **Scalability**: Easily extend your application by adding new components.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent design language throughout your application.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively implement Atomic Design in your own iOS projects and create scalable, maintainable applications.
